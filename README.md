The calCounter App

calCounter allows the user to calculate their intake of calories . The foods are divided into five categories Meat, Vegatable, Fruit , Fish & Poultry and Drinks. Each category has a list of foods which have a quantity and the amount of calories for that quantity of the given food. 

calCounter uses a SideMenu template and all of the foods data are stored in the controller.js file. 

When the calCounter application is launched it opens on the Vegetable category. There is a navigation bar on the top left, click once to reveal all of the food categories in the application, click on the desired food category to show all of the foods in that category.

There is a button to the right of each food item which contains the calories for that food item, click on the button to add the food to the calculator. Each time a food is added the total calories are displayed to the left of the add food button, this increments with every item of food added . 

At the bottom right of each food category page there is a "clear" button , click on this to reset the calCounter back to zero .

The project is available on github  : https://github.com/G00329571/ionic-assignment.
